# Data Holder

This server was generated by the [codegen](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/java-artefacts/tree/master/codegen) module.

## Overview  

We have added OR Mapping and JPA support with H2 as database, in order to demonstrate 
an end-to-end implementation of the API endpoints.

We have also added HTTP header processing according to [the HTTP header spec](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#http-headers)
